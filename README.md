ASICs seem to have narrow use cases e.g. Crypto Mining, by design. It should be pretty obvious though, that the challenge with GPUs and CPUs is NOT that they are not 'efficient' for certain applications. The problem is: they are NOT well designed. At all. Which makes them terrible for special-case uses. Multi-core architectures like GPUs are obviously helpful BUT they miss the point, hence the continuing need for ASICs in certain use cases. We need a new type of 'general purpose' chip design that is SIMULTANEOUSLY 'efficient' for specific use cases. PLCs were an attempt at this, but they suffer the pitfall of being too clumsy for 'low-power' applications. The 'lpc' project will solve this problem.
